## A Docker container, containing the dapperdox server. https://github.com/DapperDox/dapperdox

From their README :

> Themed documentation generator, server and API explorer for OpenAPI (Swagger) Specifications. Helps you build integrated, browsable reference documentation and guides. For example, the [Companies House Developer Hub](https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/api/docs/) built with the alpha version.


There is a dapperdox docker project (https://github.com/bircow/docker-dapperdox). I couldn't get this to work for multiple spec-files. Possibly a deficiency in go-wrapper.

This project will not run locally in isolation. (Maybe post POC)

To see the container in action look at https://gitlab.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/cto/api-directory
